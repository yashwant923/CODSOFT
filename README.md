# Task 1: Number Guessing Game
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! This is a simple C++ console-based game where you have to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. Test your intuition and try to guess the correct number in as few attempts as possible.

Description:

The game generates a random number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100) and asks the user to guess it. Provide feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low until the user guesses the correct number. This game showcases the use of std::random_device to generate a random number within a specified range.

# Task 2: Simple Calculator
Welcome to the Simple Calculator! This is a basic C++ console-based calculator that allows you to perform four fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Description:

The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Allow the user to input two numbers and choose an operation to perform. This task will help you practice functions and user input handling in C++.

# Task 3: Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Game! This is a simple console-based implementation of the classic two-player game where you compete to get three of your markers in a row.

Description:

The Tic-Tac-Toe game allows two players to play against each other. Create a 3x3 grid as the game board and implement logic for displaying the current board, taking player input, updating the board, and checking for a win or a draw. This task involves working with arrays and conditional statements.
